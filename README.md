# Flask Debug Project

## Explanation

### This project is meant to hone your skills in debugging inside of a Flask/Python application. This repository is riddled with errors, and you are expected to pinpoint and correct them without assistance from an instructor. The name of the game is to have a fully functional application when finished. <br /><br /> Continue to run your application and solve the errors as you go. If you receieve a new error, that's (usually) good! Move onto the next. <br /><br /> Your instructor(s) will be available for hints before the weekend, but you should use them as a last resort (you have Google, StackOverflow, and any other online references at your disposal here).

## Getting Started
   - fork from this repository
   - find the remote address for your copied repository and copy it
   - open a terminal/CMD and `git clone` your copied address
   - change into your newly created directory
   - create a new virtualenv and activate said environment
   - `pip install -r requirements.txt` to download dependencies
   - create a db in PGAdmin and add any necessary variables in a .env file
   - run your flask db commands (init, migrate, upgrade) to create table(s) that store application data

## From there..
### Let the error-handling begin!
