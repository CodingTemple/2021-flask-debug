# Flask Debug Project

## Explanation

### This project meant to be a test and to hone your skills in debugging inside of a Flask/Python application. This repository is riddled with errors, and you are expected to pinpoint and correct them without assistance from an instructor. The name of the game is to have a fully functional application when finished. <br /><br />Your instructor(s) will be available for hints before the weekend, but you should use them as a last resort (you have Gooogle, StackOverflow, and any other online references at your disposal here).

## Getting Starting
   - fork from this repository
   - find the remote address for your copied repository and copy it
